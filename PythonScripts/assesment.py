#Numbers : Numeric Data types that store values.
#Strings : They are sequences in Python.
#Lists : They are sequences in Python.
#Tuples : they are just like lists but are immutable. Once a tuple is assigned cannot again be re-assigned.
#Dictionary : These are mappings in Python. Collections of Objects sorted by a key. Represented Key/Value Pair

# Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent,
# addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25
